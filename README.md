Data Science Bootcamp Project 1

Created by: Mason DeJesus, Mrunmai Gadbail, Nicholas Buse, and Hassan Aftab

In this project, we were tasked with selecting a dataset from Kaggle.com. The dataset is located in the Resources folder, labeled as backloggd_games. The dataset was titled “Popular Video Games and Developers.” 

We then created a project proposal with a number of questions on which we would run an analysis on the data. Our project proposal is titled, “Group 9 Project 1 Proposal” and is located in the main folder.

After coming up with the project proposal, we proceeded to clean our dataset in the “data_cleaning” file in the main folder so we would be able to analyze the data and create charts for our individual sections of the analysis.

Each member of the group saved a copy of the data_cleaning file within their individual folder and created scripts to analyze the data per their individual questions: 

Mrunmai Gadbail’s work on “The Most Popular Game Titles” is located in the folder labeled Mrunmai_work. 
Nicholas Buse’s work on “Top 20 Developers” is located in the folder labeled Nick_work.  
Mason DeJesus’s work on Regressions is located in the folder labeled Masons_Work. 
Hassan Aftab’s work on “Top Genres” is located in the folder labeled Hassan_work.

On June 10, 2024, a powerpoint presentation was given to the data bootcamp class. The presentation is saved in the main folder under “Presentation.”

At the conclusion of this project, our group created a technical write-up expanding on the presentation delivered to the class, further analyzing the data and answering our individual questions or areas. This is saved in the main folder as “Technical Write-up” with an appendix saved as “Appendix A - Hassan Technical Write-up.”
